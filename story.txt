Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Marty,

I am writing to you from a funny spaceship in an analytical galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a green rocket in April. There are Six Leaves and Cities of Hound here! In the
Bedroom there is a pool full of [11]. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
50 years. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
hopping on a nano probe!!

Best wishes,
Karthik
