Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Joe,

I am writing to you from a funny spaceship in an analytical galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a green rocket in April. There are six leaves and cities of hound here! In the
Bedroom there is a pool full of blood. I fall asleep each night on a huge bed of
wood and dream of running slowly. It feels as though I have lived here for
50 years. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
hopping on a nano probe!!

Best wishes,
Karthik
